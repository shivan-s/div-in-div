# Div in Div

Here is an example of take home problem.

## How to use

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/shivan-s/div-in-div

```

The file is simple html/css and vanilla js and should run directly in the browser, but I like to use `live-server`.

```
npm i -g live-server
cd div-in-div
live-server .

```
